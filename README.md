# TF2-VTauntSpeed

**DESCRIPTION:**
Small plugin allowing players to change the speed of their vehicle taunts.
The command is `/gofast [multiplier]` (will show a menu if no value was specified).
The taunt has to be re-started for the selected multiplier to take effect.
Currently this plugin might not work with loadout taunts, but it's a start...
